# Micron. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micronjs/micronjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micronjs/micronjs)

Micron is a minimalistic (around 2k lines of code) 2d js game/app/experiments framework creation. 

It uses heavily [basejs](https://github.com/ertrzyiks/basejs), and it is inspired by a shitload of other frameworks and tools.

The main goal of Micron is to provide all needed basic tools to make tons of prototypes (and full projects) as fast as humanly possible.

Check the editor, it will be cool at some point. In the future.

Have fun!

# Getting started

Making games with Micron is quite simple, however instead of showing boring code, we give you a [full playground to test your games](http://micronjs.github.io/editor/)! Change the code, see how it's done, clic **run** and enjoy! 

The editor uses the magic of [esprima](http://esprima.org/) together with the toughness of [jshint](http://jshint.com/) to help you catching your errors and also improving your Javascript-fu along the way. We will keep improving it and adding more and more features, to make sure that learning and playing with Micron is as nice as possible.

The docs (see below) should give you an overall idea about the API, and if you want to learn more, check the demos folder! 

And yes, more demos and full blown wiki coming soon(tm)!

# Documentation 

There is a finely handcrafted documentation page [here](http://micronjs.github.io/).

# Building

If you need to rebuild distribution versions (micron lib, editor, docs, etc) you can run:

    npm run build
    
or start The Watcher, which will run the build scripts on each change in src/ folder by:

    npm start

To test the code and see the evil hints of errors (and not only), run:

    npm test

# LICENSE

All the magic of Micron is contained within an small bottle, sustained by the MIT License, which you can fully review in our lovely LICENSE file.
