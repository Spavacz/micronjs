# Micron. 2014-2015.

Micron is a minimalistic (less than 2k lines of code) 2d js game/app/experiments framework creation. 

It uses heavily [basejs](https://github.com/ertrzyiks/basejs), and it is inspired by a shitload of other frameworks and tools.

The main goal of Micron is to provide all needed basic tools to make tons of prototypes (and full projects) as fast as humanly possible.

Check the editor, it will be cool at some point. In the future.

Have fun!

# Getting started

Just check what is here! The doc should give you an overall idea and the hello world (I know: it is not enough) shows you how to... just... write hello world :)

More demos coming!
