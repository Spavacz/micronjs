# Micron. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micronjs/micronjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micronjs/micronjs)

Micron is a minimalistic (around 2k lines of code) 2d js game/app/experiments framework creation. 

It uses heavily [basejs](https://github.com/ertrzyiks/basejs), and it is inspired by a shitload of other frameworks and tools.

The main goal of Micron is to provide all needed basic tools to make tons of prototypes (and full projects) as fast as humanly possible.

Check the editor, it will be cool at some point. In the future.

Have fun!

# Getting started

Just check what is here! The doc should give you an overall idea and the hello world (I know: it is not enough) shows you how to... just... write hello world :)

More demos coming!

# Documentation 

There is a finely handcrafted documentation page [here](http://micronjs.github.io/). And more stuff will be coming soon(tm) to our very own wiki! 

# Building

If you need to rebuild distribution versions (micron lib, editor, docs, etc) you can run:

    npm run build
    
or start The Watcher, which will run the build scripts on each change in src/ folder by:1

    npm start

To test the code and see the evil hints of errors (and not only), run:

    npm test

# LICENSE

All the magic of Micron is contained within an small bottle, sustained by the MIT License, which you can fully review in our lovely LICENSE file.
