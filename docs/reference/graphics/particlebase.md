# ParticleBase : Sprite

<span class="label label-info">Class</span>

The ParticleBase class shows how to make a basic and simple particle. 
Its draw method has no body - because you must provide a way to draw them. 
This is just a very basic physic simulation for a not very impressive particle. 
Still, useful to build on top.
